\title{Firth's penalised logistic regression}
\usage{
plr(pat, tests.pat, tests.allele, n.cores = -1, p.adj.method = "bonferroni")
}
\arguments{
\item{pat}{An uncentred matrix of patterns of the allelic presence/absence status
Expect every cell of this matrix to be a dichotomous variable.}

\item{tests.pat}{A data frame specifying pairs of patterns whose association
will be tested for with the logistic regression.}

\item{tests.allele}{A data frame recording pairs of alleles whose association
have been tested for by the findPhysLink function.}

\item{n.cores}{Number of cores used to run GEMMA in parallel where possible.
     -1: automatically detect the number of available cores N, but use N - 1
cores (recommended)
     0: automatically detect the number of available cores and use all of them.
Be careful when the current R session is not running through SLURM.
     >= 1: use the number of cores as specified. n.cores is reset to the maximum
number of available cores N when n.cores > N.}

\item{p.adj.method}{Method for correcting p-values. Refer to the base function
p.adjust for legitimate values of this argument.}
}
\description{
Fit pairwise allelic presence/absence data with Firth's penalised
logistic regression without a control for bacterial population structure.
Because this function is not the focus of GeneMates, it takes as inputs the
outputs of the lmm or findPhysLink function. As a result, users must run
either function before calling this one.

Dependency: parallel, logistf and data.table
}
\examples{
assoc <- findPhysLink(...)
lr <- plr(pat = assoc$alleles$B, tests.pat = assoc$lmms.pat$dif$h1[, c("y_pat", "x_pat")],
      tests.allele = assoc$tests$dif$tests, n.cores = 8, p.adj.method = "bonferroni")
