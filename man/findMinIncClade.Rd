\title{Determine the minimal inclusive clades and calculate its frequency of
co-occurrence events of every pair of alleles.}
\usage{
findMinIncClade(
  lmms,
  allele.pam,
  clade.pam,
  clade.sizes = NULL,
  sample.dists,
  n.cores = -1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lmms}{Allele-level results from linear mixed models, generated by the
function lmm or findPhysLink.}

\item{allele.pam}{An allele-level presence-absence matrix. It is the element
[["alleles"]][["A"]] in the output list of lmm or findPhysLink.}

\item{clade.pam}{A matrix for the presence-absence of samples in each clade
of an input tree. It can be obtained using the function tree2Clades of GeneMates.}

\item{clade.sizes}{A named vector of integers for the number of samples in
each clade. It can be obtained from the element "sizes" in the outputs of the
function tree2Clades. Optional.}

\item{sample.dists}{A square matrix for distances between samples. It can be
acquired through the function projectSamples.}

\item{n.cores}{An integer determining the number of cores used for parallel
computing. Valid values are the same as those for the findPhysLink function.}
}
\description{
This function finds out the minimal clade that contains all samples
having a pair of patterns (representatives of alleles) co-occurring. It also
computes the frequency of co-occurrence events and the maximal sample distance
in each minimal clade. This function can be used for determining whether the
distributions of a pair of identically distributed alleles are identical-by-descent
(IBD). An NA vlaue appears when the patterns do not overlap (when min.co = 0).

By design, this function takes as input the outputs of the lmm or findPhysLink
function when it is applied independently. It however serves as a subordinate
function of lmm/findPhysLink as well.

\examples{
assoc <- findPhysLink(...)  # Although this command calls the findMinIncClade
function, however, a user wants to regenerate the clade inforamtion for some
reasons.
C <- projectSamples(...)
clades <- tree2Clades(...)
clonality <- findMinIncClade(lmms = assoc[["lmms"]],
    allele.pam = assoc[["alleles"]][["A"]], clade.pam = clades[["pam"]],
    clade.sizes = clades[["sizes"]], sample.dists = C[["d"]], n.cores = 16)
